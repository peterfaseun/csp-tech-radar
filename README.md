# csp-tech-radar
The Content Supply Platforms department technology radar.

## Visualisation
The current Tech Radar can be viewed [here](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsky-uk%2Fcsp-tech-radar%2Fmaster%2Fradar.csv) using the web application provided by ThoughtWorks.

## Goals
* Prove a succinct means for developers to view the technical opinions held by the department.
* To capture technical opinions in a collaborative and iterative way.

## Structure
All the technical opinions are captured as individual rows in a table kept in a simple [radar](https://github.com/sky-uk/csp-tech-radar/blob/master/radar.csv) CSV file.

The opinions are categorised into quadrants and rings on the radar as per the normal ThoughtWorks tech radar format.  
Opinions are only visualised as blips on a radar if they are 'in motion'. i.e. Only changed or new opinions are shown.

**Quadrants:**
* Programming Languages and Frameworks
* Tools
* Platforms
* Techniques

**Rings:**
* Adopt - Technologies that we should be using if appropriate for your problem.
* Trial - Technologies that are ready for use and can be trialled by some teams if needed.
* Assess - Technologies that we like the look of but are not yet sure they are ready for use.
* Hold - Besides technologies that we know are not yet ready for use, we will also include technologies which should be avoided going forward.
